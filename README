Bebo Photo Downloader

Python script to download your photos from bebo.

Someone asked me for a way to download all their albums from bebo, and so this script was born.

Usage:
bebo_dl.py
or
python3 bebo_dl.py

Enter your username and password and the script will connect to bebo and start downloading your albums to the current directory.

Command Line options:
    -h help
    -u USERNAME (specify username on command line instead)
    -o OUTPUTDIR (change output directory)

It requires python3 and the BeautifulSoup module (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

I have only used it once on Linux, but should work OK under windows too.
